            Our purpose here at Meow Peow Industries is to provide quality distractions at a fraction of the price. We promise to give our clients the highest quality distractions when you need them the most. 
            
            Our dedicated team of cats are the best distractors in the country. Even when an important deadline is approaching, our Meow Peow support team is here to keep you from finishing on time. We believe in taking time for yourself - taking a break once in awhile to play, or to feed others.
